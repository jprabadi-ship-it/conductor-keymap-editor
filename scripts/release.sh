# One-command release: build the Electron DMG for the current package.json
# version and publish it as a GitHub release, with the safety checks that
# would have caught the 2026-07-12 incident where a version bump got pushed
# (deploying the web app) with no matching DMG ever built/released, leaving
# the download button pointing at a 404.
#
# Usage: npm run release
#
# Expects: version already bumped in package.json AND a matching changelog
# entry already added to src/components/Header/Header.tsx, both committed
# and pushed to origin/main, before running this.
