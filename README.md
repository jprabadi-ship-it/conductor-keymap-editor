ConductorD Studio is a browser-based keymap editor for Conductor Monokey firmware.

## Features

- Read and write keymaps over USB with the Web Serial API.

- Edit layer names and persist them with ZMK Studio RPC.
- Configure trackball CPI, scroll sensitivity, precision mode, acceleration, and AML settings.
- Read and write tapping term settings.
- Manage combos, firmware macros, US/JIS labels, and project JSON export/import.
- Use the built-in debug console for USB/RPC troubleshooting.

## Requirements

- Chrome or Edge for Web Serial API support.
- A ConductorD/Conductor Monokey firmware build with the matching Studio RPC extensions.
- USB connection to the keyboard or dongle.

USB write operations require the device to be unlocked with the firmware's `studio_unlock` combo. BLE Studio is not used for the dongle route; the supported path is USB.
